    ###	Dog or Cat? (If you’re afraid of dogs and cats)	###

Project Name: “ Dog-Cat-Repeller.ino ”

To create an Arduino-based dog and cat repellent, you’ll need some basic components. Here are the parts you can use for this project:

Ultrasonic Sensor: You can use an ultrasonic sensor to detect the approach of animals. This sensor measures the distance and determines how close the animals are.
Ultrasonic Sensor Part Name: [— HC-SR04 Distance Sensor —]

Arduino Board: Choose a microcontroller board like Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano. This board allows you to communicate with sensors.
Arduino Board Part Name: [— Arduino Clone Nano V3.0 Microcontroller Board —]

Buzzer (Audible Alert): Use a buzzer to provide an audible warning when animals approach.
Buzzer Part Name: [— Buzzer, 5V-12V, 12mm —]

9V Alkaline Battery: You’ll need a 9V battery to power the Arduino and sensors.
9V Alkaline Battery Part Name: [— Arduino 9V Battery Power Cable —]

Breadboard and Jumper Cables: Use a breadboard and jumper cables to prototype your circuit.
Ultrasonic Sensor Part Name: [— 830-Point Breadboard + 65-Piece Jumper Cable Set + Power Module —]


Enclosure or Case: Select a box or case to house and protect all the components.
[— For 3D design, there are various tools and software available. You can create your enclosure design using tools like Blender, Tinkercad, or Fusion 360 and then 3D print it. Good luck! —]
Feel free to customize this project according to your needs. Remember to approach this project ethically and without causing harm to animals.

## Attention read ## 
This code detects the approach of animals using an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and provides a warning using a buzzer. Additionally, when the dog or cat buttons are pressed, it prints the corresponding messages to the serial monitor. Make sure to correctly connect the trig and echo pins of the sensor. You can customize the code according to your needs

Attention: Please do not use this device to harm humans or animals. Use it only to repel animals.
